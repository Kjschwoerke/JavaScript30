    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players
    console.log(players, team)

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'
    console.log(players, team)

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way (use slice() with no parameters as below)
    const team2 = players.slice()
    team2[3] = 'Poppy'
    console.log(`Team 2: ${team2} | players: ${players}`)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let team3 = [].concat(players)
    team3[3] = 'David'
    console.log(`Team3: ${team3}| players: ${players}`)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 =[...players]
    team4[3] = 'Rupert'
    console.log(`Team4: ${team4} | players: ${players}` )

    //use Array.from()
    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    team5[3] = 'Stephanie'
    console.log(`Team5: ${team5}| players: ${players}`)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    const captian = person
    person.number = 99
    person.age = 35

    console.log(captian, person)

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captian2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 200, age: 25, name: 'Jessica Smith'})
    console.log(captian2, person)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person}

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
